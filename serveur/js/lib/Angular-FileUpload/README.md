angular-file-upload
===================


**Here is the <a href="http://angular-file-upload.appspot.com/" target="_blank">DEMO</a>**

Lightweight Angular JS directive to upload files. Features:
* File upload for HTML5 and non-HTML5 browsers with Flash polyfill [FileAPI](https://github.com/mailru/FileAPI). Allows client side validation before uploading the file
* Uses regular `$http` to upload (with shim for non-HTML5 browsers) so all angular `$http` features are available
* Supports upload progress
* Supports cancel/abort upload while in progress
* Supports File drag and drop (HTML5 only)
* Supports Directory drag and drop (webkit only)
* All non-HTML5 code is in a separate shim file and could be easily removed if you only supports HTML5. (It is needed for progress event though)
* Flash FileAPI will be loaded on demand for non-HTML5 FormData browsers so no extra load for HTML5 browsers.
* `$upload` method can be configured to be either `POST` or `PUT` for HTML5 browsers.
* `$upload.http()` enables progress event for angular http `POST`/`PUT` requests. You can upload file content with the Content-Type of the file to CouchDB, imgur, etc... for HTML5 FileReader browsers. See [#88(comment)](https://github.com/danialfarid/angular-file-upload/issues/88#issuecomment-31366487) for discussion and usage.

## Usage

HTML:
```html
<!-- shim is needed to support upload progress/abort for HTML5 and non-HTML5 FormData browsers.-->
<!-- use html5-shim.js instead if you just support HTML5 browsers and you need progress event-->
<!-- Note: shim.js MUST BE PLACED BEFORE angular.js and angular-file-upload.js AFTER angular.js-->
<script src="angular-file-upload-shim.min.js"></script> 
<script src="angular.min.js"></script>
<script src="angular-file-upload.min.js"></script> 

<div ng-controller="MyCtrl">
  <input type="text" ng-model="myModelObj">
  <input type="file" ng-file-select="onFileSelect($files)" >
  <input type="file" ng-file-select="onFileSelect($files)" multiple>
  <div ng-file-drop="onFileSelect($files)" ng-file-drag-over-class="optional-css-class"
        ng-show="dropSupported">drop files here</div>
  <div ng-file-drop-available="dropSupported=true" 
        ng-show="!dropSupported">HTML5 Drop File is not supported!</div>
  <button ng-click="upload.abort()">Cancel Upload</button>
</div>
```

JS:
```js
//inject angular file upload directives and service.
angular.module('myApp', ['angularFileUpload']);

var MyCtrl = [ '$scope', '$upload', function($scope, $upload) {
  $scope.onFileSelect = function($files) {
    //$files: an array of files selected, each file has name, size, and type.
    for (var i = 0; i < $files.length; i++) {
      var file = $files[i];
      $scope.upload = $upload.upload({
        url: 'server/upload/url', //upload.php script, node.js route, or servlet url
        // method: POST or PUT,
        // headers: {'header-key': 'header-value'},
        // withCredentials: true,
        data: {myObj: $scope.myModelObj},
        file: file, // or list of files: $files for html5 only
        /* set the file formData name ('Content-Desposition'). Default is 'file' */
        //fileFormDataName: myFile, //or a list of names for multiple files (html5).
        /* customize how data is added to formData. See #40#issuecomment-28612000 for sample code */
        //formDataAppender: function(formData, key, val){}
      }).progress(function(evt) {
        console.log('percent: ' + parseInt(100.0 * evt.loaded / evt.total));
      }).success(function(data, status, headers, config) {
        // file is uploaded successfully
        console.log(data);
      });
      //.error(...)
      //.then(success, error, progress); 
      //.xhr(function(xhr){xhr.upload.addEventListener(...)})// access and attach any event listener to XMLHttpRequest.
    }
    /* alternative way of uploading, send the file binary with the file's content-type.
       Could be used to upload files to CouchDB, imgur, etc... html5 FileReader is needed. 
       It could also be used to monitor the progress of a normal http post/put request with large data*/
    // $scope.upload = $upload.http({...})  see 88#issuecomment-31366487 for sample code.
  };
}];
```

**Note**: `angular.file-upload-shim.js` must be loaded before `angular.js` and is only needed if you are supporting non-HTML5 FormData browsers or you need to support upload progress or cancel.

**Upload multiple files**: Only for HTML5 FormData browsers (not IE8-9) if you pass an array of files to `file` option it will upload all of them together in one request. In this case the `fileFormDataName` could be an array of names or a single string which would have the index appended to it (i.e. `file0`, `file1`, etc.). If you want a cross browser approach you need to iterate through files and upload them one by one like the code above. This is due to the limitation of Flash file upload.

You can also use `$upload.http()` to send the file binary or any data to the server while being able to listen to progress event. See [#88](https://github.com/danialfarid/angular-file-upload/issues/88) for more details.
This equivalent to angular $http() but allow you to listen to progress event for HTML5 browsers.

## Old browsers

For browsers not supporting HTML5 FormData (IE8, IE9, ...) [FileAPI](https://github.com/mailru/FileAPI) module is used. 
For these browsers these two files are needed:  **`FileAPI.min.js`, `FileAPI.flash.swf`** which will be loaded if the browser does not supports HTML5 FormData (no extra load for HTML5 browsers).

**Note**: Flash needs to be installed on the client browser since `FileAPI` uses Flash to upload files.

You can put these two files beside `angular-file-upload-shim(.min).js` on your server to be loaded automatically on demand or use the following script to set the FileAPI load path for example if you are using CDN (optional):
```html
<script>
    //optional need to be loaded before angular-file-upload-shim(.min).js
    FileAPI = {
        //only one of jsPath or jsUrl.
        jsPath: '/js/FileAPI.min.js/folder/', 
        jsUrl: 'yourcdn.com/js/FileAPI.min.js',
        
        //only one of staticPath or flashUrl.
        staticPath: '/flash/FileAPI.flash.swf/folder/'
        flashUrl: 'yourcdn.com/js/FileAPI.flash.swf'
    }
</script>
<script src="angular-file-upload-shim.min.js"></script>...
```
